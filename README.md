- 👋 Hi, I’m @robertdshaw
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data journalism and AI as they relate to the domains of media and risk analysis.
- 🌱 In October 2022, I completed a Data Science & Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Austin, with a 4.24 GPA.
- 💞️ In the domains of news media and political risk analysis, I’m looking to collaborate on predictive models, A/B Testing and Tableau Visualization designs.
